### Project Overview

This data science project focuses on classifying TikTok content using advanced statistical methods and hypothesis testing. The primary goal is to applying rigorous statistical techniques to address the classification problem related to TikTok data.

### Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in preparing, creating, and analyzing hypothesis tests and statistical methods in the context of the TikTok classification project.

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project is secondary data obtained from Google. It includes TikTok-related data,

### Tools

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- python libraries
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Scipy.stats

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspections.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

- Data Preprocessing: Explains how we preprocess TikTok data for analysis.
- Classification Model: Describes the model used for content classification.
- Hypothesis Testing: Details the statistical methods and hypothesis tests.
- Results: Presents the findings and analysis of the project.
- Conclusion: Summarizes the key takeaways and future directions.

## Null Hypothesis (H0)

The null hypothesis for this project states that there is no significant difference in the classification accuracy of our TikTok classification model compared to a random classifier. In other words, any observed differences in classification accuracy are purely due to random chance, and our model does not outperform random guessing.

H0: Classification Accuracy (Model) - Classification Accuracy (Random) = 0
